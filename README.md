# QA-system-demo-with-GPT-model
### Q&A trivial app based on Sematic search + gpt model
This is a demo app, which only utilizes a short article from wikipedia as reference. for more realistic model, we will need more functions/procedures including text embedding using gpt models and vector search and comparison, then use the most relevant documents as
prompt fed to gpt model for answers. Detailed info can be found in OpenAI documentation.
